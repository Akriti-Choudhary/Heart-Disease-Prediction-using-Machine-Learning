# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning <br>

<br>
<h3>Workflow</h3> <br>

<b>Heart Data -> Data Preprocessing -> Train Test Split -> Logistic Regression Model</b><br><br>
<b> New Data -> Trained Logistic Regression Model -> Healthy Or Heart Defect Prediction </b>

<br><h3>About the dataset</h3> <br>
The dataset has been downloaded from kaggle. The "target" field in the dataset refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. The "target" field is integer valued where 0 represents Healthy Heart and 1 represents Heart Disease. 

<br><h3>About the Prediction Model</h3> <br>
The Logistic regression model is used. Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables. The outcome is 0 or 1 integer value. The result is then printed accordingly.
